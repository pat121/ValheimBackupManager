
This utility is designed to prevent loss of game progress for many reasons, including but not
limited to:
  1.) Frequent switching between Steam profiles or computer accounts
  2.) Freak accidents involving the Steam Cloud
  3.) Annoying siblings that mess up your save

All of these and more are my inspiration for creating this tool. Enjoy!

Usage cases:

	VBM backup <world-name> [world-type]
		Copies the given file to the backups directory. If the file already exists, you will
		be asked if you want to overwrite it. The world-type argument is optional and tells
		VBM if it is a world or a character that you want to back up. The default is world.
	VBM restore <world-name> [world-type]
		Copies the given file from the backups directory back to the game directory. Asks for
		confirmation if the file already exists in the game directory. The world-type argument
		is optional and tells VBM if it is a world or a character that you want to back up. The
		default is world.
	VBM setgamepath <path>
		In the (extremely) rare case that your Valheim data is stored in a place other than the
		default directory, this command lets you specify where your data is stored.
